**Help us build a great computer science resource for our Indiana K-12 teachers!** As part of a recent grant to the School of Informatics and Computing (IUPUI) from the Indiana Department of Education, there is an opportunity to contribute to a repository of 90+ learning activities to serve K-12 teachers.

**ðŸ’² Stipends are available for contributing K-12 teachers and university faculty.** Educators will collaborate on each activity to produce an engaging experience for students. Individual stipends will be determined based on the number of contributing educators per each activity developed. Industry professionals will provide feedback on most activities to signify industry alignment.

## The Process

### **STEP 1 ðŸ‘‰  Complete** [**this form**](https://forms.gle/HhyGn3NtKhSRtEf89) **if you are interested in collaborating on an activity (or several).**

### **STEP 2 -** Once potential contributors are identified we will propose collaborations to you that meet the requirements for the grant.

### STEP 4 - Collaborating teams submit a proposal for review that outlines the activity topics, standards, and description of the intended student deliverable.

### STEP 5 - Collaborating teams submit a complete activity document for review and refinements, as needed.
