# Computing by Design Activities

**The School of Informatics and Computing is building this repository with the support and guidance of the Indiana Department of Eduction**. Expect to see frequent updates to the available activities over the coming year and beyond.&#x20;

**The computer science activities cover various levels (K-12) and offer intersections with many course subject areas.** Each activity will have an intended length of approximately one or two classroom hours. Activities will be organized into the following **seven practices **adopted from the US K-12 CS Framework.

****[**INCLUDE EVERYBODY**](activities/include-everybody/)\
**Fostering an Inclusive Computing Culture:** Incorporate perspectives from people of different genders, ethnicities, and abilities. To do this, teachers must first understand the personal, ethical, social, economic, and cultural identities/contexts in which they and their students operate. [**Learn more >**](activities/include-everybody/)****

****[**WORK TOGETHER**](activities/work-together/)\
**Collaborating Around Computing:** Work effectively with colleagues to plan and reflect on lessons and create complex artifacts. Collaboration requires teachers to navigate and incorporate diverse perspectives, conflicting ideas, disparate skills, and distinct personalities. [**Learn more >**](activities/work-together/)****

****[**SHARE INSIGHT**](activities/share-insight/)\
**Communicating About Computing:** Communicate with diverse audiences about the use and effects of computation and the appropriateness of computational choices. Write clear comments, document work, and communicate ideas using precise language and multiple forms of media. [**Learn More >**](activities/share-insight/)****

****[**INVESTIGATE THE DETAILS**](activities/investigate-the-details/)\
**Recognizing and Defining Computational Problems:** Define problems, break them down into parts, and evaluate each part to determine whether a computational solution is appropriate. [**Learn more >**](activities/investigate-the-details/)****

****[**SEE THE BIG PICTURE**](activities/see-the-big-picture/)\
**Developing & Using Abstractions:** Identify patterns and extract common features from specific examples to create generalizations in order to simplify the development process and manage complexity. [**Learn more >**](activities/see-the-big-picture/)****

****[**MAKE THINGS**](activities/make-things/)\
**Creating Computational Artifacts:** Create artifacts that are personally relevant or beneficial to the community and beyond, by combining and modifying existing artifacts or by developing new artifacts. Examples of computational artifacts include programs, simulations, visualizations, digital animations, robotic systems, and apps. [**Learn more >**](activities/make-things/)****

****[**IDENTIFY IMPROVEMENTS**](activities/identify-improvements/)\
_Testing and Refining Computational Artifacts_: Test and refine computational artifacts in a deliberate and iterative process. Respond to the changing needs and expectations of end users and improve the performance, reliability, usability, and accessibility of artifacts.
