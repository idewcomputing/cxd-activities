# Designing for All Abilities

**Accessibility** is an important design consideration with any digital technology. While you may able to see a mobile app interface just fine, maybe others find it difficult. In this exercise we want to investigate how we can improve the accessibility of an app for people with **low vision**. It will require you to **practice empathy** and see the world through the eyes of others.
