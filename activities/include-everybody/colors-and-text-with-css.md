**Help is needed to make this short story engaging, but easy to read for all!**

**Accessibility** is an important design consideration with any digital technology. While you may able to see a screen interface just fine, maybe others find it difficult. In this exercise we want to investigate how we can improve the accessibility of a web site for people with **low vision**. It will require you to **practice empathy** and see the world through the eyes of others.

As you can see this short story needs some style improvements. It's hard to read and not very engaging.

### **Instructions**

**This exercise requires access to a coding environment. Starting code is provided on replit.com but can be adapted to another platform.**

#### **1 - Make a copy (fork) of the starter web site code for a short story.**

* Starter code: [https://replit.com/@jlyst/colorAndFont](https://replit.com/@jlyst/colorAndFont#style.css)

#### **2 - Notice the color and font-size styles in the **_**styles.css**_** file**. Try making some changes to colors and font sizes.

* For example, you can change the _title_ `color` and `font-size` by editing the CSS shown below. Remember, the _title_ is in a `<h1>` element in the _index.html_ file.

```css
h1 {
  color: yellow;
  font-size: 14px;
}
```

#### 3 - Now consider what would be great colors and font sizes that make the short story fun and engaging, while being easy to read by all. Consider the following items and discuss your ideas with others.

* Fun colors that provide a unique experience to the site.
* Colors that provide high contrast so that it is easy for all to read.
* Font sizes that make reading easy while keeping the site layout organized.

#### 4 - Implement your changes and test them yourself. How does it look if your screen is set to low brightness? How about if you have bright lights shining on the screen, like the sun?

#### 5 - Have three other people look at your site and ask them how easy it is to read. This would be a great opportunity to ask someone you know whose eyesight might not be a clear as yours. Make adjustments based on the feedback.

### üéâ You can now share your site link with your teacher, friends and family for enjoyment .

## **Rubric**

Provide a simple rubric with three to four criteria to guide the expectations of the activity.

|                             | Exemplary                                                                                                                                                             | Standard                                                                                                                                          | Needs Improvement                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Story Format and Engagement | The title, author, picture, and story displayed appropriate structure, where the title was pronounced and paragraphs structure was consistent. The style is engaging. | The structure of the site was good, but subtle changes could improve the balance of the page elements, alignment, overall organization, or style. | The edits made to the site tended to noticeably degrade the structure of the short story visually, where items were out of balance or mis-aligned. |
| Accessibility (Font Sizes)  | The font sizes supported great accessibility to a varying audience of visual acuity while not introducing an awkward layout.                                          | The font sizes were appropriate, but may have over (or under) compensated certain elements slightly.                                              | The font sizes do not reflect careful consideration of users with various visual acuity.                                                           |
| Accessibility (Color)       | The colors provided good contrast, providing a pleasant reading experience under most circumstances.                                                                  | The color provided good contrast in normal conditions, but may present some problems under bright lighting or for those with vision impairment.   | The colors did not provide enough contrast under normal conditions or the color choices were clearly too vibrant.                                  |
