# Sketch an App

You probably know that people sketch ideas for shoes, houses, and movie plots. But did you know people do the same for mobile and computer apps? This is an important skill for **user experience designers** and **user interface designers**. In this exercise you will **sketch an interface storyboard** for a new app to share your idea with others.

### **Instructions**

1. **Determine a topic for an informational mobile application**, an app that someone would use to get great information on a particular topic -- like recipes, fitness routines, school subjects, colleges, etc.&#x20;
2. **Brainstorm ways that you could design the interface for a mobile app to search or browse information**. Come up with at least three different ideas by creating very simple sketches.
3. **Discuss your ideas and sketches with somebody else** to get some quick feedback.
4. **Choose a design direction and create at least two screen views** that represent how that application would look, helping people understand how it would work as well.

### üéâ Share your sketches with your teacher, friends, and family.

## **Rubric**

Provide a simple rubric with three to four criteria to guide the expectations of the activity.

|                | Exemplary | Standard | Needs Improvement |
| -------------- | --------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| Sketch Detail  |           |          |                   |
| Sketch Clarity |           |          |                   |

## **Extension Activities**

### Create a Dynamic Prototype

You can take your sketches or create digital wireframes to create an interactive prototype rather quickly. Marvel is one of many options to consider.
