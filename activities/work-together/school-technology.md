Many people depend on school technology – students, teachers, parents, and administrators. Designing or choosing the right tools for a large organization can be very complicated. Features that work great for one group many not work well for another. In this exercise you will interview different [**stakeholders**](https://www.wordnik.com/words/stakeholder) to uncover what is working well, or not, with your school's learning managements system. With this information you can then make a few recommendations for improving how the technology is used.
