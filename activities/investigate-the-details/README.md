## Topics

### **User Experience Research**

**UX (user experience) research** is the careful study of computer applications (apps), the target users, and how well the computer applications serve the needs of the users. Through a systematic process researchers can uncover problems with application and opportunities for improvement.

#### You can use three approaches to your research.

> ðŸ’¬  **You can listen to what users say about a product** by using techniques like interviews and surveys, \
> ðŸ‘€  **you can observe what user do with a product, **and\
> ðŸ¤”  **you can do an independent review** based on heuristics (or "rules of thumb").&#x20;

All three approaches are valuable and require the researcher to practice **empathy** for the best results. Each approach has it's advantages and disadvantages, and often UX researchers will use several techniques to develop a thorough evaluation.
