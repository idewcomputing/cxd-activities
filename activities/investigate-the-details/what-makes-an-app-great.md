# What Makes an App Great?

**We have all used apps that we think are great, but we have also used some that we didn't enjoy so much. **In this activity we want to dig a little deeper to investigate what characteristics support a good experience by evaluating an app and sharing the evaluation results. _#noCode #design #6-12_

## **Instructions**

**In this activity you will evaluate an application **by conducting an independent review using usability principles as a checklist, followed by a written report or class presentation summarizing your findings and recommendations for improvement.

1. **Choose an application that you would like to evaluate consistent with your teacher's parameters.**\
   ****
2. **Determine two primary tasks that can be completed with the application by a user to solve a problem. **For example, on Youtube 1) a user that wants to repair a faucet searches for a how-to video, and 2) an astronomy hobbyist wants to generate a fan base and starts a channel for her videos.\

3.  **Complete a analysis by evaluating the app according to these usability principles for each task.**\
    ****\
    ****✅ **Functionally Correct** - Does the application allow you to complete the task correctly?

    ✅** Efficient to Use **- Is the application allow a task to be done in a timely manner?\
    ✅ **Easy to Learn **- Is the application intuitive to use the first time?

    ✅ **Easy to Remember **- Does the application support a memorable experience for later visits?

    ✅ **Error Tolerant** - How easy can errors be made? Does the application support undoing errors?

    ✅ **Subjectively Pleasing** - Is the app engaging and provide an appropriate emotional experience?\
    \
    For each of these items provide a descriptive summary of what is done really well or has room for improvement. \

4. **Develop ways to improve the application based on your analysis,** whether it is changes to the interface or how tasks are completed. You could sketch how you might improve the interface or create a diagram explaining a new flow for the interaction.\

5. **Summarize your findings and possible improvements.** Whether providing a written report or presentation, provide a clear review of your analysis of each usability principle and the problems identified. Followed by your top recommendations for improvement.

| Analysis of Usability Problems       | Each of the usability principles are addressed with thoughtful insights demonstrating empathy for users    | Each usability principle was addressed with a meaningful response | The analysis does not demonstrate careful coverage of all the usability principles                      |
| Generation of Ideas for Improvement  | Ideas are presented that demonstrate a creative process and well-developed response to identified problems | Ideas are presented that appear to address identified problems    | Ideas lack clear connection to identified problems or opportunities for improvement seemed to be missed |
| Organization and Communication       | The document or presentation provided a clear and easy-to-follow summary of the work in an engaging manner | The organization and content were largely clear and error-free    | The document or presentation lacked coherence or had errors distracting the message                     |

## **Extension Activities**

### Think Aloud Protocol

As described in the background section, there are other approaches to evaluating user experience. Consider trying the _think aloud protocol_. In a _think aloud protocol_ you ask test participants to use the application while they think out loud — simply sharing their thoughts as they move through the interface. Below is a link to a video demonstration.
