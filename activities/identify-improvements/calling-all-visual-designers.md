### **Instructions**

**This exercise requires access to a coding environment. Starting code is provided on replit.com but can be adapted to another platform.**

#### **1 - Make a copy (fork) of the starter web site code for a short story.**

* Starter code: [https://replit.com/@jlyst/colorAndFont](https://replit.com/@jlyst/colorAndFont#style.css)

#### **2 - Notice the styles in the **_**styles.css**_** file that are applied to the heading, text input and button**. Try making some changes to colors, font sizes, and borders.

* For example, you can change the _title_ `color` and `font-size` by editing the CSS shown below. Remember, the _prompt_ is in a `<h1>` element in the _index.html_ file.

```css
h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 14px;
}
```

#### 3 - Now consider what would be great colors and font sizes that make the short story fun and engaging, while being easy to read by all. Consider the following items and discuss your ideas with others.

* Fun colors that provide a unique experience to the site.
* Colors that provide high contrast so that it is easy for all to read.
* Font sizes that make reading easy while keeping the site layout organized.

#### 4 - Implement your changes and test them yourself. How does it look if your screen is set to low brightness? How about if you have bright lights shining on the screen, like the sun?

#### 5 - Have three other people look at your site and ask them how easy it is to read. This would be a great opportunity to ask someone you know whose eyesight might not be a clear as yours. Make adjustments based on the feedback.

### ðŸŽ‰ You can now share your site link with your teacher, friends and family for enjoyment .
