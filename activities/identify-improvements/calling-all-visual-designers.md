### **Instructions**

**This exercise requires access to a coding environment. Starting code is provided on replit.com but can be adapted to another platform.**

#### **1 - Make a copy (fork) of the starter web site code for a search interface.**

* Starter code: [https://replit.com/@jlyst/improveInterface](https://replit.com/@jlyst/improveInterface)

#### **2 - Notice the styles in the **_**styles.css**_** file that are applied to the heading, text input and button**. Try making some changes to colors, font sizes, and borders.

* For example, you can change the _title_ `color` and `font-size` by editing the CSS shown below. Remember, the _prompt_ is in a `<h1>` element in the _index.html_ file.

```css
h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 28px;
}
```

#### 3 - Now consider what would be great colors, border styles, and font sizes that make the search interface fun, engaging, and easy to use. Consider the following items and discuss your ideas with others.

* Colors that provide a unique experience to the site.
* Text, input field, and button sizes that draw attention to the search function.
* Border styles to the input field and buttons that refine the visual experience.

#### 4 - Implement your changes and test them yourself. How do they look on screen of different sizes?

#### 5 - Have three other people look at your site and ask them how usable and engaging it is. Make adjustments based on the feedback.

### ðŸŽ‰ You can now share your site link with your teacher, friends and family for enjoyment .
