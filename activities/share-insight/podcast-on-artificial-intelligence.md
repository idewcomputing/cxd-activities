# Podcast on Artificial Intelligence

**Artificial intelligence is improving fast**, but people are often unsure of how it works and what benefits and risks it introduces. In this exercise we will generate a podcast that presents the latest trends in artificial intelligence in a **clear and concise** way.

### **Instructions**

#### 1 - **Select two recent articles on artificial intelligence to review for your podcast.**

Here is a great source for articles.

#### 2 - **Outline a summary for each article.** In addition to citing the author and place it is published (e.g. magazine, journal, or blog), use these questions to outline the talking points for the article.

* What does the article set out to explain or propose?
* What are the main ideas?
* Are there specific examples or scenarios presented?
* Where does the article fit in among artificial intelligence applications? Is the general IA or narrow AI?
* Is the article about AI research or current application in the real world?

#### 3 - Outline a script for your five-minute podcast. Remember, think about your intended audience.

* **What will be your introduction and hook to engage listeners?** Introduce the topic in an interesting way.
* **What main ideas do you want to share from each article?** Will you present them in sequence or is there a common thread that allows you to discuss the both at the same time?
* **What opinions or questions do you want to leave the listeners with to close out your podcast?**

#### 4 - Record your audio podcast

This may take a few tries and you may choose to add some music, if you know how to do that. Ultimately, you want to speak clearly, provide continuity to what you present, and keep the discussion engaging.

### üéâ Share your podcast with your teacher, friends, and family.

## **Rubric**

Provide a simple rubric with three to four criteria to guide the expectations of the activity.

|                  | Exemplary                                                                                              | Standard                                                                    | Needs Improvement                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Content          | The podcast clearly covered articles on AI in a complete and accurate manner.                          | The podcast content sufficiently covered the content from two articles.     | The podcast was too brief, lacked details, or was generally hard to follow.               |
| Engaging         | The content was presented in a very interesting and novel way that urged the listener to follow along. | The content was presented in a way that should maintain listener attention. | The content was presented with few engaging perspectives or methods to draw listeners in. |
| Delivery (Voice) | The podcast was very well articulated with excellent pacing.                                           | The podcast was clear spoken without major disruptions.                     | The podcast could have been recorded with more clarity in voice and better rehearsed.     |

## **Extension Activities**

Provide a one or two extension activities that teachers and students may choose to do. Include a brief description of how each extension could be approached.

### Creat a Video Version

Consider creating a video version that uses photos, diagrams, or charts from the article to help visually engage the user.

### Outline a Series

Create an outline of a series of AI podcasts by identifying six more articles (three podcasts) that could be reviewed. Provide a summary for each of the three upcoming podcasts that would promote your series.
