# Write a Story for Code

**Code has a story line ‚Äì really.** If you think carefully about it, anytime we use an app we could describe things like characters, plots, and settings. Sure, it will read different than your favorite movie script, but it has a similar structure. In this exercise you will generate something called **pseudocode** for an app. No programming required, just a careful description of how a program works.

## Instructions

### **Instructions**

1. **Choose a mobile app, web site, or desktop application that has some clear user interaction**. (e.g. social media platforms)
2. **Determine a complex task that can be completed with the application** . (e.g. take a photo and share it within a particular social group)
3.  **Write a story, in your normal speaking language, that explains that task step by step.**&#x20;

    Think about it as an interaction between two characters -- the user and the computer. The story can start with what the user wants to do. Then you can follow this pattern for each little step in the task...

    1. What does the user see on the interface?&#x20;
    2. How does the user interact with the interface? (Do they click a button, type text etc.)
    3. How does the program do and how is the interface giving feedback to the user?&#x20;
    4. Back to #1
4. **Review your story for clarity and accuracy in conveying how the application works.**

### üéâ Share your code story with your teacher, friends, and family.

## **Rubric**

Provide a simple rubric with three to four criteria to guide the expectations of the activity.

|                  | Exemplary | Standard | Needs Improvement |
| ---------------- | --------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| Criteria Label 1 |           |          |                   |
| Criteria Label 2 |           |          |                   |
| Criteria Label 3 |           |          |                   |

## **Extension Activities**

Provide a one or two extension activities that teachers and students may choose to do. Include a brief description of how each extension could be approached.

### Try Pseudocode

Go a step further and use pseudocode to describe the task process.

### Create a Flow Chart

Let's make the story visual with a chart.
