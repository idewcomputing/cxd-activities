**Have you ever heard of the 80/20 rule?** Well, it is shows up a lot of ways in life, but one example has to do what features get used in an application. We could say that the top 20% of features in an app get used 80% of the time by the users. So identifying the high priorities features can be really important. In this exercise we will analyze an application and generate a prioritized list of features.&#x20;
